Instruction for cancellation: [CANCELLATION_INSTRUCTIONS]

### Free Trials and Promotional Periods
We may offer free trials or promotional periods for our subscription services. Unless otherwise stated, free trials automatically convert to paid subscriptions at the end of the trial period.

You are eligible for one free trial per subscription plan unless we explicitly permit otherwise. We reserve the right to determine eligibility for free trials and to limit or prohibit free trials at our discretion.

### Refunds

## Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

### Informal Dispute Resolution
Before filing a claim against us, you agree to attempt to resolve the dispute informally by contacting us at [DISPUTE_CONTACT_EMAIL]. We will attempt to resolve the dispute by contacting you via email. If the dispute is not resolved within 30 days after submission, you or we may initiate formal proceedings.

### Agreement to Arbitrate
You and we agree to resolve any disputes between us through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You acknowledge and agree that you are waiving the right to sue in court, have a jury trial, or participate in a class action.

This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and shall survive the termination of these Terms. The arbitration will be conducted by [ARBITRATION_PROVIDER] under its then-current rules and procedures, including any supplementary procedures for consumer-related disputes.

### Exceptions to Arbitration
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following shall not be subject to arbitration: (1) small claims court cases that qualify; (2) disputes related to intellectual property (like patents, trademarks, and copyright); (3) disputes related to or arising from allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (4) any claim for injunctive relief.

### Arbitration Procedures
To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: [COMPANY_ADDRESS]. The arbitration will be conducted in [ARBITRATION_LOCATION] unless you and we agree to conduct it elsewhere. If the value of your claim does not exceed $10,000, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the arbitration rules.

### Arbitration Fees
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the arbitration provider's rules. If the arbitrator finds that your claim is non-frivolous, we will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration, regardless of who initiated the proceeding.

### Class Action Waiver
YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

### Opt-Out Procedure
You have the right to opt out of this arbitration agreement within 30 days of the date you first agreed to these Terms by sending a signed letter stating your decision to [OPT_OUT_ADDRESS]. If you opt out of this arbitration agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you.

### Severability
If any part of this arbitration agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable in its entirety.

### Changes to Arbitration Agreement
Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if we make any future change to this arbitration agreement (except a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change.
